# Course Organization

## Lectures

Lectures have two formats: whiteboard presentation and slides
presentation.

**Attending lectures is absolutely critical.**

Slides and lecture notes will be made available after lectures, but
they will be difficult to understand in isolation. Readings will cover
some---but not all---of the course material.

## Readings

Most lectures are paired with a reading. These are *optional* and
classes will not exactly follow the readings, but you will get more
out of the lectures if you skim the readings afterwards. Readings will
be drawn from these books:

- **UML**: [Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/) by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David
- **MLaPP**: [Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) by Kevin Patrick Murphy
- **ESL**: [The Elements of Statistical
Learning:](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Trevor
Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman

You are welcome to buy physical copies if you wish---they're good books!---but
the online versions will suffice for this course.

## Homeworks

- Each homework will have two parts: a programming component and a
written component.

- There will be 5 homeworks in total, issued roughly every two
weeks. Homeworks will generally be posted *after* lecture on Thursday,
and are due roughly two weeks later *before* lecture.  Keep an eye on
the calendar!

- Late homework **will not be accepted**---we will not have a late day
policy.  Instead, your lowest homework score will be dropped. Limited
partial credit is possible for partial homework solutions.

- **Collaboration policy**: you can discuss with other students about
  the homework, but you must write up and code up the solutions on
  your own! You also must mention the names of the students you
  discuss with.

## Midterm and Final exam

- Due to COVID-19, there will be no midterm exam. We will have a
  take-home final exam.

## Grading Policy

Your grade will be based on these components:

- **Homeworks**: 72%
- **Final Exam**: 18%
- **Participation**: 10%

Your lowest homework score will be dropped.
