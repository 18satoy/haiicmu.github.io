# Instructions

## Basics

Homeworks will be posted on Canvas *after* class the day they are assigned, and
they will be due *before* class on the due date. **Late homework will not be
accepted**. Instead, your lowest homework grade will be dropped.

## Grading

TBA.

## Programming Assignments

- All programming in **Python**. Please get familiar with:
	- Python3
	- Python Notebook (Jupyter)

- **Installation**: Most programming assignment will be done in a
Python notebook.  You can run your code on [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  If you prefer to run your
code on your local machine, you should install
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

	<!-- - a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) virtual environment -->
    <!-- with all of the packages pre-installed -->

- UMN computing resources:
	- [UMN Virtual Online Linux Environment](https://vole.cse.umn.edu )


## Written Assignments

For the written assignments, it is required that you typeset your
homeworks in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/). There are many
free integrated LATEX editors that are convenient to use (e.g
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)).

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates on homework
problems, but each person must write up the final solutions
individually. You should note on your homework specifically which
problems were a collaborative effort and with whom. You may *not*
search online for solutions.


## Outside Sources
- Outside sources are a bit less clear. You should **not**:
	- Google around for solutions to homework problems.
	- Ask for help on online.
	- Look up things/post on sites like Quora, StackExchange, etc.

## The Bottom Line

**If you are unsure about whether a source is permissible, or if you
are falling behind in the course and feel a strong temptation to bend
these rules, please come talk to us instead.**
