# Welcome to Human-AI Interaction!

## Syllabus

In short, the goal of this course is to introduce students to ways of
thinking about how Artificial Intelligence will and has impacted
humans, and how we can design interactive intelligent systems that are
usable and beneficial to humans, and respect human values. As students
in this course, you will build a number of different interactive
technologies powered by AI, gain practical experience with what
impacts their usability for humans, understand the various places that
humans exist in the data pipeline that drives machine learning, and
learn to think both optimistically and critically of what AI systems
can do and how they can and should be integrated into society.

## Communication

- **Canvas**: We will be using Canvas for all assignments and grades.
Please also post all questions on Canvas as discussions instead of
sending emails.

-  **Email**: If you email your instructors, you must include the
  substring "HAII Course" to begin a meaningful subject line and have
  tried to resolve the issue appropriately otherwise. For example, you
  should post questions about course material and homework assignments
  on Canvas first, and then use emails only after an appropriate
  amount of time has passed without a response. Please use your CMU
  email account.

## Homeworks

- Each homework will have two parts: a programming component and a
written component.

- There will be 5 homeworks in total, issued roughly every two
weeks. Homeworks will generally be posted *after* lecture on Thursday,
and are due roughly two weeks later *before* lecture.  Keep an eye on
the calendar!

- Late homework **will not be accepted**---we will not have a late day
policy.  Instead, your lowest homework score will be dropped. Limited
partial credit is possible for partial homework solutions.

- **Collaboration policy**: you can discuss with other students about
  the homework, but you must write up and code up the solutions on
  your own! You also must mention the names of the students you
  discuss with.
