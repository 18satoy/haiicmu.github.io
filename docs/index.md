# Welcome to CSCI 5525!

## Syllabus

Machine Learning is about how we make predictions and decisions based
on data. This course covers the theory and practical algorithms for
machine learning from a variety of perspectives. We cover topics such
as support vector machines, neural networks, boosting, statistical
learning methods, unsupervised learning, online learning, and
reinforcement learning.


## Logistics
- **Course**: CSCI 5525, Spring 2020
- **Location**: Keller Hall 3-230
- **Time**: Mondays, 6:30 PM‑9:00 PM

## Communication

- **Canvas**: We will be using Canvas for all assignments and grades.
Please also post all questions on Canvas as discussions instead of
sending emails.

- **Email**: If you email your instructor, you must include the
  substring "CSCI 5525" to begin a meaningful subject line and have
  tried to resolve the issue appropriately otherwise. For example, you
  should post questions about course material and homework assignments
  on Canvas first, and then use emails only after an appropriate
  amount of time has passed without a response. Please use your UMN
  email account.
